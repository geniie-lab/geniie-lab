# geniie-lab

**geniie-lab** is an open-source testbed that allows you to instruct large language models to perform search actions such as querying, ranking, clicking, judging relevance, and reformulating across configurable, modular stages. By analysing the resulting structured responses, researchers can better understand the search behaviours of different LLMs, identifying bottlenecks and improvement opportunities in retrieval-augmented applications.
